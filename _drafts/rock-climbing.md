A few month's back my girlfriend introduced me to rock climbing at a local gym.
We signed up for a four-month contract, and started right away with all the
bouldering and top-roping my heart could desire.

During that time I've learned so much about footwork and body positioning.
Essentially, the balance of my body in relation to it's base of support.
Initially, I did suffer from a rather bad elbow pains, which I believe was due
to weak tendons which have since strengthed! Hopefully I never suffer
tendonitis.

## Shoes

Around a month and a half in I bought my first pair of rock climbing shoes from
REI. For me that was a pair of Evolv's Defy shoes. At a low cost, they felt and
have served me well. Shoe's seemed to make a huge impact in my technique. The
rental pairs had a lot of variance between the pairs I was given and often even
had issues with slipping on positive-edge holds.

## Harness

My next purchase was a more comfortable harness, which in all honesty could have
been a delayed purchase as I think I spend much more time bouldering than doing
top-rope routes. Regardless, if you have a gut and some spare money, a harness
is a comfortable improvement over the straps they rent to you at the gym.

After trying on some pairs I decided that I really liked the feeling of Black
Mountain's Momentum SA harness. The front has some great buckles that adjust
with a downward pull. The waistband is a bit hard to pull back but we'd rather
have sturdy than slippery, right?!

## Chalk Bag

After that I grabbed a chalk bag from Black Diamond that has a nice little
zipper on the back-side. Not much else to say about chalk bags. I think the
chalks I'll buy and use will be a much more interesting to research.
