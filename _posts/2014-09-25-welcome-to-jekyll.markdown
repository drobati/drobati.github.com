Even though I'm now running Jekyll with blogging functionality, I'll probably
not use it. I'd prefer to just provide a static presentation of who I am to you.
Let's see what I can do with this for now though. Eventually I would like to
replace the original Django server running [robati.com](http://www.robati.com).

Who knows maybe I will try and use this more. It wouldn't be bad to keep a
journal of sorts.
