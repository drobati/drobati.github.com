<p>Programming is a passion of mine, because it combines many of the things I love.
Problem solving, creativity, networking, computing, social interactions, and
efficiency are just some aspects that draw me to my craft. As a kid, I've always
held an interest in computers, and programming was something that I enjoyed.</p>
<p>So I decided to get a B.S.C.S. from Southern Polytechnic State University, or
SPSU in Merietta, GA. Interestingly, I never found the course work overly
rewarding, and I've always held the opinion that my friendships outside school
with other programmers drove me to excel. I learned about functional programming
from Slava Shirokov long before I even saw a course on it. I learned how to
build emacs from scratch, learned how to write and deploy a Django
application, and how to commit often with git.</p>
<p>These days I no longer use emacs, but prefer vi. I usually run Ubuntu 14.04
with awesome, urxvt, gvim, and google-chrome. I adore Python and love developing
software with it.</p>
<p>Currently I am working in the telecommunications industry with ADVA Optical
Networking. I've been with ADVA for nearly 8 years, where I started as an Intern
while attending college. I now am a critical member of an international team of
German, Polish, and American nationals. Our small team supports a large initive
of automation globally across the company. Automation is such an important part
of the development process, as it tests robustness and regression as no manual
execution could ever dream.</p>
<p>Here specifically we developed a Python framework for Robot Framework. In
combination with Jenkins, we have developed invaluable test execution and
reporting.<p>
